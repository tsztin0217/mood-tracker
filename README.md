# ðŸŒ™ Moody - A Personal Mood Tracker

Growing up, I often heard the saying that we shouldn't "overthink" or dwell too much on things that make us unhappy. The idea was to just move on. But over time, I realized that ignoring my emotions didn't make them disappearâ€”it just made them harder to understand. Sometimes, Iâ€™d feel a lingering sadness or frustration but wouldnâ€™t remember why.

Moody was inspired by this realization and by advice from my therapist: to write down my emotionsâ€”both happy and sad. By doing so, I could start recognizing patterns, understanding what truly makes me happy, and figuring out how to navigate difficult emotions.

I built Moody not just for myself, but for anyone who wants to better understand their emotions. Itâ€™s not just about tracking the bad daysâ€”itâ€™s also about celebrating the good ones. By keeping a record of our happiest moments, we can revisit them when we need a reminder of joy and find ways to create more of those experiences.
